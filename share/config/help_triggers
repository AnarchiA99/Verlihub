[--] Manage triggers
--------------------
[-] !lsttrigger  List available triggers
[-] !addtrigger <trigger> [ -d <definition> ] [ -h <description help> ] [ -f <flags> ] [ -n <send as nick> ] [ -c <min_class> ] [ -C <max_class> ]  Add a new trigger
[-] !modtrigger <trigger> [ -d <definition> ] [ -h <description help> ] [ -f <flags> ] [ -n <send as nick> ] [ -c <min_class> ] [ -C <max_class> ]  Change a trigger
[-] !deltrigger <trigger>  Remove a trigger
[-] !htrigger  Show an help and available trigger flags

[--] Here there is a explanation of command parameters:
<trigger>: the name you want the trigger to be called
-d <definition>: the definition of the trigger. This can be point to a file on file system or it can be the trigger content (if the correct flags are specified). In this case you need to enclose the content in quotes. For i.e. -d "This is the trigger contents."
-h <description help>: this is not used by VerliHub. It is a simple note for OPs that describes what trigger does
-f <flags>: this is a flag bitset. These will govern how VerliHub will use the trigger and/or how it displays it to the user. See below for more information about available flags
-n <send as nick>: when VerliHub sends message to the main chat window, the trigger will appear to send from this nickname
-c <min_class>: the minimum user class allowed to use this trigger
-C <max_class>: the maximum user class allowed to use this trigger

[--] Flags
--------------------
Number	                     Description
0	         Send to main chat (visible to user only)
1	         Execute command in the trigger
2	         Message is sent to PM
4	         Automatically execute trigger when user logs in
8	         Execute trigger with +help/!help command
16	         The definition of the trigger is the trigger content. Enclose it in quotes
32	         Replace variables in the trigger. For more information see the list below
64	         Message is sent to everyone in the main chat window

[--] If you want to use more than one flag just sum them. For example:
-f 0:  send trigger only in main chat
-f 6:  send message to user on login, and in the PM window (2+4)
-f 10: trigger is executed on +help/!help and it sends in the PM window (8+2)
-f 14: send message on login and on +help/!help to a PM (4+8+2)
-f 50: use definition as trigger contents and send to PM window with variables (16+32+2)
-f 64: send to everyone in main chat window
--------------------
Variables
--------------------
[--] You can use some variables in the trigger file or content that will be automatically replaced with special value. You can use this feature only if you set flag 32:
%[NICK] - User's nickname
%[SHARE] - User's share size in kilobytes
%[SHAREPEAK] - User's share size maximum in kilobytes
%[CC] - User's country code
%[CN] - User's country name
%[IP] - User's IP address
%[CFG] - This is the configuration path of the hub (where it is located dbconfig file
%[HOST] - User's hostmask (dns_lookup must be set to 1 for this to work)
%[HUBNAME] - The hub name
%[HUBDESC] - The description of the hub
%[CLASS] - The class of the user who has run the command
%[HUBTOPIC] - Hub topic
%[USERS] - The number of users in the userlist
%[USERS_ACTIVE] - The number of active users in the userlist
%[USERS_PASSIVE] - The number of passive users in the userlist
%[USERSPEAK] - Show max users reached by the hub
%[TOTAL_SHARE] - Total amount shared in hub
%[UPTIME] - Hub uptime
%[VERSION] - Hub version
%[VERSION_DATE] - Hub's release date
%[PARALL] - All parameters written after command
%[PAR1] - Only first parameter written after command
%[END1] - The command itself and all parameters written after it
%[ss] - Current seconds
%[mm] - Current minutes
%[HH] - Current hours
%[DD] - Current day
%[MM] - Current month
%[YY] - Current year

[--] When you use the definition as the actual trigger contents, you cannot use quotations in the text! Otherwise only a part of the message will be saved. You need to edit the database directly in this case.
+motd, +help, +faq, +rules are always trigger so you can edit their behaviour setting different flags. For example, if you want to send the FAQ to a PM window use this command: !modtrigger +faq -f 2
